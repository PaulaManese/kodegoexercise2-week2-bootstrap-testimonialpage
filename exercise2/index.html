                <p>I fell in love with the ND brand shadows and in this palette, it is my 1st palette of this park. The palette is veeery monothematic - that is, the make-up made with these shadows will be very similar, but some will be darker - warmer, others lighter and more golden-brown ... well, I like it and it fits my taste. If someone likes warm shades of brown and is a nude freak, I recommend it! glossy shadows do not flake off, they transfer perfectly with a finger and a brush. The mats - they are super pigmented - which makes them light dust, but the shadows do not lift up in the palette, they are not dry and the structure of these mats is unique. I have used several leading Polish brands, but nooo these mats are a piece of cake.</p>

               <h6 class="display-6"><b><u>Worth its price</u></b></h6>
                <p>The palette is great. The colors are warm and beautifully highlight the green iris. I bought mainly for mats because, contrary to appearances, it is not easy to find dark warm browns ... they might be ubiquitous, but somehow those from most of the palettes are either red or lose their heat on the eye. The fact is not a clear palette. But it's not a fault for me. The makeup comes out expressive and nicely highlights the eye. More medium than super dark smoky;). The fact is that there is no one super bright color to illuminate the inner corner, but I have the impression that the bronze and glam palettes have been very thoughtful and complementary. It begs you to mix them together by eye :). As for the quality, I have absolutely nothing to complain about, although my requirements are high and so far I have painted myself only with ABH shadows..</p>

                <p>I agree with the opinion below. If someone starts their adventure with Natasza's shadows from this palette, I do not advise you. The mats are nice and ok, the shadows are too dark for me. Makeup made with this palette comes out very dark and does not necessarily suit everyone. It overwhelms me. I have other shades of Natasza, better both in terms of quality and color. I love the Gold palette. If you have been disappointed with this palette, do not give up on Gold, because it is the best palette on the market and the colors knock down the blue iris beautifully. I give 4 stars because Bronze is a good palette, but its colors are too heavy for me and the flashes do not match Gold.

                <p>The colors of this palette will win a large group of customers and fans. Thanks to the "understatement" (as in the case of other ND palettes) the shades, their multidimensionality will suit basically any type of beauty. For me, an amateur of makeup, the quality of the product is excellent, as is the case with the Gold and Lilla palettes, which I also have. Compared to the Gold palette, these shades of brown are "brickier, redder" and virtually completely different! I highly recommend it and luckily for the wallet, the price is cheaper, although the total weight of the product is lower. Additionally, a handy and beautiful package.

                <p>I waited a long time for Natasha's palette, which will be suitable for everyday, fast, but still full of style and shine makeup. And finally it is!
                    Great pigmentation, wonderful colors and this packaging allows you to start each day with a bit of luxury.
                    I recommend it to beginner makeup fans, because these advanced Natasha Denona products need no introduction.</p>

                <p>Colors are repetitive and a pallette this size is not necessary for the cost. there are beautiful shimmers and it is a nicely formulated palette for the shimmers, however there are plenty of pallets out there that mimic this one for half the price. Some of the mattes are patchy and don't blend properly. I returned this palette the next day after trying it. Don't waste your money.</p>
